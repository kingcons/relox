### Developing

You need Esy, you can install the latest version from [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```bash
yarn global add esy@latest
# Or
npm install -g esy@latest
```

> NOTE: Make sure `esy --version` returns at least `0.5.8` for this project to build.

Then run the `esy` command from this project root to install and build depenencies.

```bash
esy
```

Now you can run your editor within the environment (which also includes merlin):

```bash
esy $EDITOR
esy vim
```

Alternatively you can try [vim-reasonml](https://github.com/jordwalke/vim-reasonml)
which loads esy project environments automatically.

After you make some changes to source code, you can re-run project's build
again with the same simple `esy` command.

```bash
esy
```

This project uses [Dune](https://dune.build/) as a build system, and Pesy to generate Dune's configuration files. If you change the `buildDirs` configuration in `package.json`, you will have to regenerate the configuration files using:

```bash
esy pesy
```

### Running Binary

After building the project, you can run the main binary that is produced.

```bash
esy start
```

### Running Tests

You can test compiled executable (runs `scripts.tests` specified in `package.json`):

```bash
esy test
```

### Building documentation

Documentation for the libraries in the project can be generated with:

```bash
esy doc
open-cli $(esy doc-path)
```

This assumes you have a command like [open-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-cli) installed on your system.

> NOTE: On macOS, you can use the system command `open`, for instance `open $(esy doc-path)`

### Creating release builds

To release prebuilt binaries to all platforms, we use Github Actions to build each binary individually.

The binaries are then uploaded to a Github Release and NPM automatically.

To trigger the Release workflow, you need to push a git tag to the repository.
We provide a script that will bump the version of the project, tag the commit and push it to Github:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh
```

The script uses `npm version` to bump the project, so you can use the same argument.
For instance, to release a new patch version, you can run:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh patch
```
